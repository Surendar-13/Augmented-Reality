# AR Hand Tracking Drawing App 🎨

This project is a **hand-tracking-based virtual drawing app** built using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It allows users to draw on a digital canvas using hand gestures captured through a webcam, with features like color selection and undo functionality.

## Features ✨

- **Hand Tracking**: Tracks hand movements using the MediaPipe library.
- **Virtual Drawing**: Draw lines on a digital canvas by raising your index finger.
- **Color Selection**: Change the brush color based on the number of raised fingers.
  - 1 finger: Black
  - 2 fingers: Green
  - 3 fingers: Red
- **Undo Feature**: Make a fist gesture to undo the last drawn stroke.
- **Color Palette Display**: A color palette is shown for easy reference.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Watch the webcam feed alongside the drawing canvas.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and image processing.
- **MediaPipe**: For real-time hand tracking.
- **NumPy**: For creating and managing the drawing canvas.

## Setup and Installation 🖥️

1. Clone the repository:
