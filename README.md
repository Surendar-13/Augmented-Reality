- **Color Palette Display**: A color palette is shown for easy reference.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Watch the webcam feed alongside the drawing canvas.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and image processing.
- **MediaPipe**: For real-time hand tracking.
- **NumPy**: For creating and managing the drawing canvas.
